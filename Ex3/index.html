    <p id="bannerText">GOAT</p>
</div>
<div class="content" id="cont1">
    <p class="indent"> The goat or domestic goat (Capra hircus) is a domesticated species of goat-antelope typically
        kept as livestock. It was domesticated from the wild goat (C. aegagrus) of Southwest Asia and Eastern
        Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the tribe Caprini, meaning it is closely
        related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. It is one of the oldest domesticated
        species of animal, according to archaeological evidence that its earliest domestication occurred in Iran at
        10,000 calibrated calendar years ago.</p>

    <p>Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world. Milk from
        goats is often turned into goat cheese.</p>

    <p>Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies, and juvenile goats
        of both sexes are called kids. Castrated males are called wethers. While the words hircine and caprine both
        refer to anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of
        domestic goats.</p>

    <p>In 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the UN Food and Agriculture
        Organization.</p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="cont2">
    <p class="contHeader">Etymology</p>
    <p class="indent">The Modern English word goat comes from Old English gāt "she-goat, goat in general", which in
        turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf. Norwegian/Icelandic geit, German Geiß, and Gothic gaits),
        ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰaidos meaning "young goat" (cf. Latin haedus "kid"). To refer to
        the male, Old English used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th
        century. Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century, and billy goat (for males) originated in the
        19th century.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="cont3">
    <p class="contHeader">History</p>
    <p class="indent">Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The most recent genetic
        analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains is the
        likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.</p>
    <p> Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their
        dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and
        tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years Before Present are found in Ganj
        Dareh in Iran. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami, Djeitun,
        and Çayönü, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years ago as the domestication date.</p>
    <p> Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for
        sale. It has also been used to produce parchment.</p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="cont4">
    <p class="contHeader">Anatomy and health</p>
    <p class="indent">Each recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 140 kg (300 lb)
        for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 20 to 27 kg (45 to 60 lb) for smaller goat does. Within each
        breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range
        are miniature breeds such as the African Pygmy, which stand 41 to 58 cm (16 to 23 in) at the shoulder as
        adults.</p>

            <p class="cardContent">Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on
                the breed. There
                have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a
                genetic rarity thought to be inherited. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to
                be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked.
                Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals
                among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded
                by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.</p>

                the
                goat genome. It is completely dominant to all other alleles at this locus. There are multiple
                modifier genes which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed, so a tan-patterned goat
                can
                have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red.</p>

<div class="content" id="cont5">
    <p class="contHeader">Diet</p>
    <p class="indent">Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and cardboard
        boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsing animals, not grazers like
        cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything
        remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and
        paper (such as labels from tin cans).</p>
    <p>Aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume,
        preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant.
        However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which
        are otherwise toxic. They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing
        starvation. This is one reason goat-rearing is most often free-ranging, since stall-fed goat-rearing
        involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.</p>
    <p>Goats prefer to browse on vines, such as kudzu, on shrubbery and on weeds, more like deer than
        sheep, preferring them to grasses. Nightshade is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats.
        Silage (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after
        opening – goats are particularly sensitive to Listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds. Alfalfa, a
        high-protein plant, is widely fed as hay; fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay. Mold in a
        goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it. In various places in China, goats are used in the
        production of tea. Goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves
        (which contain bitter tasting substances), but instead eat the weeds. The goats' droppings fertilise the tea
        plants.</p>
    <p>The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is
        essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal. Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having
        bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is
        undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its
        capacity to absorb nutrients.</p>
    <p>The adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed (genetic potential) and its diet
        while growing (nutritional potential). As with all livestock, increased protein diets (10 to 14%) and
        sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than
        lower protein rates and limited calories. Large-framed goats, with a greater skeletal size, reach mature
        weight at a later age (36 to 42 months) than small-framed goats (18 to 24 months) if both are fed to their
        full potential. Large-framed goats need more calories than small-framed goats for maintenance of daily
        functions.</p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="cont6">
    <p class="contHeader">Life expectancy</p>
    <p class="indent">Life expectancy for goats is between 15 and 18 years. An instance of a goat reaching the
        age of 24 has been reported.</p>
    <p>Several factors can reduce this average expectancy; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life
        span to 10 or 11, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to eight to 10 years.
